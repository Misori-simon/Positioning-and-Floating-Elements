                    <p>
                        CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named 
                        Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late 
                        with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
                    </p>

                    <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that 
                        should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have 
                        made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course 
                        of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that 
                        exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed 
                        of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
                    </p>

                    <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look 
                        uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous 
                        ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles 
                        were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew 
                        a double box around it.
                    </p>

                    <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had 
                        seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically 
                        as inflation, looked right.
                    </p>

                    <p>Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to 
                        <a href="#">the first sliver of cosmic time</a> 
                        with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the
                         Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of 
                         space-time — so-called 
                        <a href="#">gravitational waves</a>
                          — the signature of a universe being 
                         wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a 
                         trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of 
                         inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
                    </p>

                    </div>

                    <p>Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. 
                        Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the 
                        recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. 
                        It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years 
                        in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a 
                        larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own 
                        universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, 
                        like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>‘As Big as It Gets’</h3>

                    <p>In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies 
                        forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into 
                        gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational 
                        waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of 
                        the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded 
                        in gravitational waves.”
                    </p>

                    <p>The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation 
                        that permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old 
                        and as hot as the surface of the sun.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging
                         of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the 
                         Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical 
                         Journal.

                                <strong>THE UNIVERSE</strong>  is just under 14 billion years old. 
                                From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere that 
                                is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery. 
                                Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                <strong>NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong>  The universe is not old enough for 
                                light to have traveled the vast distance from one side of the universe 
                                to the other, and there has not been enough time for scattered patches 
                                of hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                <strong>DISTANT COFFEE</strong>  At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope 
                                to look a mile in one direction. You see a coffee cup, and from the amount of 
                                steam, you can estimate its temperature and how much it has cooled.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                <strong>COFFEE EVERYWHERE</strong>  Now turn around and look a mile in 
                                the other direction. You see a similar coffee cup, at exactly the same 
                                temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every 
                                direction, you might want to look for another explanation.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                <strong>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong>  There has not been enough time to 
                                carry coffee cups from place to place before they get cold. But if all the coffee
                                 cups were somehow filled from a single coffee pot, all at the same time, that 
                                 might explain their even temperature.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                <strong>INFLATION</strong>  solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a 
                                trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the 
                                speed of light. Tiny ripples in the violently expanding energy field eventually grew 
                                into the large-scale structures of the universe.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                <strong>FLUCTUATION</strong>  Astronomers have now detected evidence of these 
                                ancient fluctuations in swirls of polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, 
                                which is energy left over from the early universe. These are gravitational waves 
                                predicted by Einstein.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                <strong>EXPANSION</strong>  Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central 
                                pot expanding faster than light and cooling to an even temperature as it expands. 
                                That is something like inflation. And the structure of the universe mirrors the 
                                froth and foam of the original pot.
